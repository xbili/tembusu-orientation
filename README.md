# Tembusu Orientation 2015

## Why this was created

Since orientation is an annual event, I thought it'd be good to have a system of deploying and building the website from scratch for each year. So voila! Presenting to you the **Tembusu Orientation** repository.

## What more is there to be done for this project?

There's TONS of improvements to be made for this project. If you would want to get a list of them, refer to the GitHub issue list. Since this project is Open Source, feel free to raise any issues you've encountered, or suggest any improvements that you feel is good!

Here's are two meat-ish projects that could be further worked on:

1. CRUD API to interact with a database for the updates and posts
2. Travis CI for deployment

## Getting Started

To setup, make sure that you have:

1. `npm`
2. `bower`

After cloning the repository, first we run:

`npm install`

to get all our `npm` modules.

Followed by:

`bower install`

to get our `bower` modules.

Run `grunt watch` and navigate to `localhost:3000` and happy coding! :3

(Wow simple enough right?)

## Workflow

Yes, we use Git.

All changes should be submitted as a pull request into `development`. The naming convention for your branch shall follow either one of these:

1. `feature/<feature name>`
2. `issue/<issue number>`

## Style Guide

(Shall be updated soon in the Wiki, because code quality is important)
